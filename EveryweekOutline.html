 <b>TITLE:</b> VICTORIOUS LIFE
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>TEXT:</b> 1 JOHN 5:1-5
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>INTRO:</b>
    <br>
    Every person desires victory (problems, temptations, failures). 
    The world defines it as success, but true victory is not external, it is spiritual. 
    The Christian life is not a defeated life.
