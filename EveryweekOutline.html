    Isaiah 40: "<b>25</b> To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the Holy One. <b>26</b>Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one faileth. <b>27</b> Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is passed over from my God? <b>28</b> Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his understanding.<b>29</b> He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increaseth strength.<b>30</b> Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men shall utterly fall:31 But they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint."
    <br>
    Isaiah 40: <b>18<b/> To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye compare unto him? <b>19</b> The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.<b>20</b> He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved."
